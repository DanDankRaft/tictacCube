as for pause menu:
    We need to add a pause button first, with || text.
        Button calls UIActions.Pause()

    Pause menu will darken everything (Place a darkening sprite/image?)
    Will have the word "Pause" and a Start Over button.
        Start over will call UIActions.Restart()
    Pressing anywhere that isn't text or Start over will call UIActions.Resume()


    Functions to add to UIActions:
        Pause()- disables CameraMovement and Placement, disables pause button's button component, activates PauseMenu object.
        Resume()- enables CameraMovement and Placement, enables pause button's button component, de-activates PauseMenu object.
